def is_palindrome(word):
    if len(word) <= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] != word[-1]:
        return False
    return is_palindrome(word[1:-1])

Explanation:

The function is_palindrome takes a string word as input.
The first if statement checks if the length of the word is less than or equal to 1, in which case the word is a palindrome and the function returns True.
The second if statement checks if the first and last characters of the word are not equal, in which case the word is not a palindrome and the function returns False.
If the first and last characters of the word are equal, then the function calls itself recursively with the substring of the word from the second character to the second-last character (i.e., word[1:-1]).
This process continues until the word is reduced to a single character or an empty string, at which point the function returns True (because all the characters have been matched and the word is a palindrome).
